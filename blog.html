            <h3>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>var:</h4><br>

                        <b>Function scope:</b> Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are accessible only within the function in which they are declared. <br>
                        <b>Hoisting:</b> Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope. This means that you can use a variable before it's declared, but its value will be undefined until it's assigned.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>let:</h4><br>

                    <b>Block scope:</b> Variables declared with let have block-level scope, which means they are accessible only within the nearest pair of curly braces ({}) where they are defined. <br>
                    <b>Hoisting:</b> Like var, variables declared with let are hoisted to the top of their containing block, but unlike var, they are not initialized, so referencing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>const:</h4><br>

                    <b>Block scope:</b> const variables also have block-level scope, just like let. <br>
                    <b>Immutability:</b> Variables declared with const are constants, meaning their values cannot be reassigned after declaration. However, it's important to note that for objects and arrays declared with const, the object or array itself is still mutable (i.e., you can change its properties or elements), but you cannot reassign the variable to a new object or array.

            <h3>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>undefined</h4>
                    <b>Default Initial Value:</b> When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it is automatically initialized with undefined. <br>
                    <b>Function Return Value:</b> If a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it will return undefined by default. <br>
                    <b>Parameter Value:</b> If a function is called with fewer arguments than declared parameters, the missing parameters are assigned undefined. <br>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>null</h4>
                    <b>Explicit Absence of Value:</b> null is often used to explicitly indicate the absence of a value or the intentional removal of a value from a variable or object property. <br>
                    <b>As a Placeholder:</b> Developers might use null as a placeholder value when initializing variables or properties, intending to assign a meaningful value later. <br>
                    <b>Checking for Missing Objects:</b> It can be used to check if an object property exists or has been set.
                </li>

            <h3>What do you mean by REST API?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> REST API is a standardized way for software applications to communicate over the internet using HTTP methods to perform operations on resources, following principles like statelessness and resource-based URLs. It enables data exchange between different systems, making it a fundamental technology for web services and integration</li>
